Advanced Vulnerability Scanner
 Overview
The Python Vulnerability Scanner is a multithreaded tool designed to scan specific IP addresses for open ports and common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The tool offers comprehensive vulnerability detection, customizable port scanning, and the ability to log scan results. It supports both fast and stealth modes for evading firewalls and detection systems.

Features
- Port Scanning: Scan a specific IP address for open ports in the range of 1 to 1024.
- Vulnerability Detection:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi): Detects potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities using common payloads.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Identifies XSS vulnerabilities with a variety of malicious scripts.
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Checks for missing CSRF tokens in the response.
- Multithreading: Utilizes multiple threads to speed up scanning, allowing multiple targets to be scanned concurrently.
- Stealth Mode: Slows down the scanning process to avoid detection by firewalls.
- Timeout Management: Allows users to set custom timeouts to prevent hanging on unresponsive ports.
- Detailed Logging: Logs all open ports and discovered vulnerabilities, as well as any errors encountered during the scan.
- Result Saving: Option to save the scan results to a text file for later analysis.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SecuritySphere/Advanced_vulnerability_scanner.git
2. Install the required dependencies: The script uses Python's built-in libraries (requests, socket,    threading, logging, queue, and time). These are part of Python’s standard library, so no external dependencies are needed.
If you need to install Python, use:
sudo apt-get install python3  # For Linux
brew install python3  # For Mac
python -v  # For Windows

Usage
You can start scanning targets using the following command:
python vulnerability_scanner.py -ip <target_ip> [options]
Command-line Options:
•	-ip <target_ip>: (Required) Specify the target IP address to scan.
•	-sp, --start-port: Set the starting port for port scanning (default: 1).
•	-ep, --end-port: Set the ending port for port scanning (default: 1024).
•	-proto, --protocol: Choose the protocol to use for scanning (tcp by default).
•	-t, --threads: Specify the number of threads to use for multithreaded scanning (default: 5).
•	-to, --timeout: Set the socket timeout for each connection (default: 1 second).
•	-s, --stealth: Enable stealth mode for slow scanning to avoid firewall detection.
•	-o, --output: Save the scan results to a file (optional).
Example Usage:
Basic Scan:
python vulnerability_scanner.py -ip 192.168.1.1 -sp 1 -ep 1024 -proto tcp -t 5
Stealth Mode Scan:
python vulnerability_scanner.py -ip 192.168.1.1 -sp 1 -ep 1024 -proto tcp -t 1 -s
Save Scan Results:
python vulnerability_scanner.py -ip 192.168.1.1 -sp 1 -ep 1024 -proto tcp -t 5 -o scan_results.txt
How It Works
The scanner uses Python's socket module to attempt TCP connections to the target IP on the specified range of ports. If a connection is successful, it logs the port as open. The scanner also performs web vulnerability checks by sending HTTP requests with malicious payloads for SQL Injection, XSS, and checks for missing CSRF tokens.
The script leverages multithreading for faster performance and can adjust its speed with stealth mode to avoid detection by firewalls. All open ports and vulnerabilities are logged into scan_log.txt.
Vulnerability Detection:
•	SQL Injection (SQLi): Detects SQLi by injecting payloads and checking for database error messages in the response.
•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Checks if user-supplied content is echoed back in the response unescaped.
•	Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Detects missing CSRF tokens in forms.
Error Handling
The script is designed to handle the following errors:
•	Timeouts: Avoids hanging by using timeouts for unresponsive ports.
•	Connection Refusals: Marks ports as closed if a connection is refused.
•	Unreachable Hosts: Logs errors if the target host is unreachable.
